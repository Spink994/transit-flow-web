# Project Title

Transit-flow

## Description

Your gateway to any destination in the world

## Getting Started: Cloning the Repo

First step is to clone the repo to your local PC using either github desktop or github CLI on your computer.
https://github.com/Spink994/transit-flow-web.git

### Install the Dependencies

CD into the project directory and install the dependencies:

# Go to the project directory

$ cd transit-flow-web (this can be found inside 'documents/github' folder on your computer)

### Installing

# Install the dependencies

$ yarn install (This is the default install manager that was used. To use npm read the information below)

$ npm install ( to use npm make sure you delete the yarn.lock file before running npm install and if there are errors running this then use the 'npm -force install' command)

### Executing program and Testing

Runs the app in the development mode using:
yarn run dev or npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build or yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject or yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
